# Facetools

[Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) is nice, but I really don't want to install dlib.
dlib need compile in c++, its installing very slow, using model of cnn's inference speed is very slow too.

May better choice: [https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface)
